 Everybody gets high sometimes you know What else can we do when we're feeling low So take a deep breath and let it go You shouldn't be drowning on your own And if you feel you are sinking on one jump Ride over into cold, cold water for you And all the time it takes us into different places I will still be patient with you And I hope you know I'll let go I'll be your last fine side I'll be your last fine side Cause we all get lost sometimes you know It's how we learn and how we grow And I wanna lay with you till I'm old You shouldn't be fighting on your own And if you feel you are sinking on one jump Ride over into cold, cold water for you And all the time it takes us into different places I will still be patient with you And I hope you know I'll be your last fine side Cause we all get lost sometimes you know And if you feel you are sinking on one jump And I hope you know I'll be your last fine side Come on, come on, send me from the rock and bow I just wanna stay us alone I'm all alone And I hope I'll get someone for me to take me home And somewhere I can rest my soul I need to know I'll be your last fine side Cause we all get lost sometimes you know And I hope I'll be your last fine side Cause we all get lost sometimes you know And I hope I'll get someone for me to take me home
